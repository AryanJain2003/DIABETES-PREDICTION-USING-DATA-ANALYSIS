# DIABETES PREDICTION USING DATA ANALYSIS
I performed exploratory data analysis and model training on a diabetes dataset, including parameters like glucose, blood pressure, etc,  to predict early-stage diabetes. For model training, I used KNN , Random Forest, Decision Tree Classifier, and Logistic Regression and compared them on the basis of accuracy, precision, and F1-score.
